# OOP JavaScript Game Show
Simple phrase-guessing game to demonstrate OOP concepts.

The player is presented with a secret phrase, chosen randomly, and must then guess the phrase by guessing letters. If all the letters are guessed correctly, it's a win! But after five incorrect guesses, the game is lost.

Guesses can be entered either by clicking on the letter buttons, or by typing the corresponding letters on the player's keyboard.

### Style Changes
Main background color, phrase letter space colors, and letter button colors have all been updated to a blue theme, as well as adding a drop shadow to the letter buttons. Font scheme was changed to Racing Sans One and Open Sans.
